        <h2>Goulash Recipe: </h2>
        <p>
            Hungarian goulash is a rich, flavorful stew made with tender beef, onions, and paprika, 
            which gives it its signature deep red color and smoky-sweet taste. To prepare, start by 
            sautéing chopped onions in lard or oil until golden brown, then add cubed beef (typically chuck or shank)
             and sear until browned. Stir in a generous amount of Hungarian sweet paprika, garlic, caraway seeds, salt, 
             and black pepper, coating the meat evenly. Add diced tomatoes or tomato paste for depth, 
             followed by beef broth or water, and let it simmer gently for about 1.5 to 2 hours until the meat becomes tender.
        </p>
        <p>
            For an authentic touch, toss in diced potatoes, carrots, or bell peppers in the final 30 minutes of 
            cooking to enhance the texture and flavor. Some variations also include csipetke, small hand-pulled 
            noodles, for extra heartiness. Adjust seasoning as needed and serve hot, garnished with fresh parsley. 
            Traditional Hungarian goulash is best enjoyed with crusty bread or buttered noodles, 
            making it a comforting and satisfying dish perfect for cold days.
