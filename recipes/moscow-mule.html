        <h2>Moscow Mule Recipe:</h2>
        <p>
            The Moscow Mule is a classic cocktail made with vodka, ginger beer, and lime juice, 
            typically served in a copper mug. To prepare, fill a copper mug with ice cubes, 
            add vodka, and squeeze fresh lime juice over the ice. Top it off with ginger beer 
            and stir gently to combine. Garnish with a lime wedge or wheel and a sprig of fresh mint. 
            The Moscow Mule is known for its refreshing and zesty flavor, making it a popular choice 
            for summer gatherings and parties.

            For a twist on the traditional recipe, try using flavored vodka such as citrus, berry, 
            or ginger-infused varieties. You can also experiment with different types of ginger beer 
            to find your preferred level of sweetness and spiciness. Some variations include muddling 
            fresh fruit or herbs in the cocktail for added complexity. Whether enjoyed on a hot day 
            or as a festive drink during the holidays, the Moscow Mule is a versatile and easy-to-make 
            cocktail that is sure to impress your guests.
