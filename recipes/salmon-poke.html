        <h2>Salmon Poke Recipe:</h2>
        <p>Salmon poke is a fresh and flavorful Hawaiian dish featuring cubed raw salmon marinated in 
            a savory-sweet sauce. To prepare, start with high-quality sushi-grade salmon, 
            cut into bite-sized cubes. In a mixing bowl, combine soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, 
            and a touch of honey or brown sugar for balance. Add finely chopped green onions, sesame seeds, 
            and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes or sriracha for a mild kick. 
            Toss the salmon gently in the marinade and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes
             to absorb the flavors.
        </p>

            For serving, prepare a bowl with steamed sushi rice or mixed greens as the base. 
            Arrange the marinated salmon on top and garnish with sliced avocado, cucumber, seaweed flakes, 
            or pickled ginger for extra freshness. Some variations include edamame, tobiko, or crispy 
            wonton strips for added texture. Drizzle with extra sesame oil or spicy mayo before serving. 
            Enjoy this refreshing salmon poke bowl as a light and nutritious meal, perfect for warm days.
